# Installing the EV Car Charger
Figuring out how to wire up an electric car charger.

## Needed equipment

* Multimeter
* Noncontact voltage tester
* 2 meters of Romex
* 1 40 amp fuse
* silicon caulk
* drill
* flathead screwdriver
* Phillips-head screwdriver
* wire stripper
* wire cutter

## Steps

1. Move the shelf aside, leaving ~80 centimeters in which to work.
1. Shut off the breaker at the house.
1. Manually disconnect incoming power from the solar panels.
1. Test that power does not work in the shed.
1. Turn off the main disconnect.
1. Turn off the breaker for the solar panels.
1. Remove the front of the subpanel.
2. Using the noncontact voltage tester, again test that power does not work.
1. Strip the ends of the Romex, exposing 3 centimeters.
1. Affix the positive and negative wires to the breaker.
1. Affix the ground wire to the ground.
1. Install the 40 amp breaker.
1. Clamp the wire at the entrance to the subpanel.
1. Remove the wall panel below the subpanel and pull back the insulation.
1. Run the Romex down the wall, attaching it to the side of a stud with stapes.
1. Locate a stud to mount the charger to.
1. As necessary, use an auger bit to drill through any intervening studs to reach the identifed stud.
1. Measure to the code-prescribed height above the ground for the cable exit.
1. Drill a hole through the wall, at the diameter of the Romex, immediately adjacent to the stud.
1. Feed the Romex through the wall.
1. Affix the charger-mount to the exterior wall.
1. Cut off the Romex, leaving a length of perhaps 20 centimeters, verifying that the amount can be coiled up inside of the charger when it's hanging on the wall.
1. Affix the feed-through bushing to the exterior wall.
1. Apply silicon caulk around the feed-through bushing.
1. Screw three strands of the Romex into the charger terminals.
1. Hang the charger on its mount.
1. Verify visually that there is no exposed wire.
1. Turn on the main disconnect in the subpanel.
1. Turn on the breaker at the house.
1. Test that the charger turns on.
1. Shut off the breaker at the house.
1. Turn off the main disconnect.
1. Close up the wall panel.
1. Put the cover back on the subpanel.
1. Turn on the breaker for the solar panels.
1. Manually reconnect incoming power from the solar panels.
1. Turn on the breaker at the house.
1. Sweep up shavings, etc.
1. Move the shelf back into place.
